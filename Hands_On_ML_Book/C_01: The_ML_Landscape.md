## Exercises
In this chapter we have covered some of the most important concepts in Machine Learning.

1. How would you define Machine Learning?
   -- Machine Learning is about building systems that can learn from data.
   Learning means getting better at some task, given some performance measure.
   
2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?
  -- Machine Learning is great for complex problems for which we have no algorithmic solution,
   to replace long lists of hand-tuned rules, to build systems that adapt to fluctuating environments,
   and finally to help humans learn (e.g., data mining).
   
6. What is a labeled training set?
   A labeled training set is a training set that contains the desired solution (a.k.a. a
label) for each instance.
8. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
   -- The two most common supervised tasks are regression and classification.
10. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
    -- Common unsupervised tasks include clustering, visualization, dimensionality
reduction, and association rule learning.
12. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to
walk in various unknown terrains?
13. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple
groups?
14. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning prob‐
lem or an unsupervised learning problem?
15. What is an online learning system?
16. What is out-of-core learning?
17. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predic‐
tions?
18. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithm’s
hyperparameter?
19. What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common
strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?
20. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?
21. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new
instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?
22. What is a test set and why would you want to use it?
23. What is the purpose of a validation set?
24. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?
25. What is cross-validation and why would you prefer it to a validation set?
