# Understanding Machine Learning: Types, Tasks, and Algorithms

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Unlike traditional programming, where explicit instructions are given, ML models identify patterns and relationships in data and improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.

## Key Concepts in Machine Learning

### Learning from Data
- **Training Data**: The data used to train the model. It contains input-output pairs (features and labels) in supervised learning.
- **Features**: The input variables (attributes) used to make predictions.
- **Labels**: The output variable (target) in supervised learning.

### Model
A mathematical representation of the relationship between input features and the output label. Models can range from simple linear equations to complex neural networks.

### Training
The process of adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs using a training dataset.

### Prediction/Inference
Using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

### Evaluation
Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error on a validation or test dataset.
