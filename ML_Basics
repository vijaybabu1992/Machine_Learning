  - **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification problems.
  - **Decision Trees**: Tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.
  - **Random Forests**: Ensemble of decision trees to improve classification accuracy.
  - **SVM**: Finds the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes.
  - **KNN**: Classifies based on the majority label of the nearest data points.
  - **Naive Bayes**: Based on Bayes' theorem, assumes feature independence.
  - **Neural Networks**: Especially useful for complex classification tasks (e.g., image recognition).

- **Regression**: Used when the output is a continuous value. For example, predicting house prices.
  - **Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
